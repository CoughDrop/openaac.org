## Welcome to The OpenAAC Initiative

<img src='openaac.svg' style='height: 150px; float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;'/> 
OpenAAC is an initiative to create and encourage open-licensed
resources and tools to support AAC (Augmentative and Alternative
Communication) users. We believe that AAC users should have 
flexibility and control over their communication modalities.
It is important for companies to create sustainable business
models that can reliably support AAC users, but business 
practices that interfere with AAC user freedoms are inappropriate.

There is a growing international effort to create open-licensed
materials and tools with the goal of communicator autonomy, and
we are proud to contribute to this work!

We are parents, therapists, vendors and developers who believe
that users should have control and be able to mix and match to create the experience that works best for them. Here are some of our beliefs:

### Goals
1. __Open Systems__ Communicators should have an option for a free, flexible AAC system.
2. __Open Boards__ Users should be free to export their vocabulary sets if they need to switch to a different AAC system ([the Open Board Format](https://openboardformat.org)). 
3. __Open Vocabularies__ People should have access to free, robust, pre-made vocabulary sets that they can import into the system that works best for them.
4. __Open Symbols__ Therapists and education teams should be free create and share classroom materials that use the same symbols available on AAC systems ([opensymbols.org](https://www.opensymbols.org)).
5. __Open Lessons__ Teachers and families should have access to free learning resources and ideas for modeling with and supporting communicator learning ([Communication Workshop](https://workshop.openaac.org)).
6. __Open Voices__ Communicators should have a range of free, high-quality voice output options.
7. __Open Integrations__ Third parties should be able to integrate tools into AAC systems in a standardized way ([AAC Shim](https://tools.openaac.org)).

The OpenAAC Initiative will be a place to find and share open-licensed tools and applications. We are in the process of organizing an advisory board to drive the strategy for this initiative, but in the mean time you can review the existing tools and resources. Remember, all of these initiatives are released with an open license, and are free to use, share and build on top of.
